# Food Ordering App

This is a Food Ordering app built using TypeScript for Android and iOS platforms using React Native framework, with Expo for easier development and Expo Router for navigation.

The app includes features such as shopping cart implementation, Stripe payment integration, order placing, user login and signup, and order tracking.

## Features

- **Shopping Cart Implementation:** Users can add items to their cart while browsing through the menu, review their selected items, and proceed to checkout.
